## 概要
### 
The timing of repeat caesarean section after previous multiple caesarean sections has long been a balance (‘the art of obstetrics’) between the notion of maternal morbidity from anecdotal instances of antenatal scar rupture, maternal haemorrhage related to abnormal placentation, the onset of preterm labour requiring emergency caesarean section with its associated increased morbidity from maternal haemorrhage and infection andneonatal morbidity, which may be immediate and predominantly respiratory in nature, or possibly later with neurodevelopmental morbidity associated with late preterm and early term delivery of the neonate, as reported by Blencowe et al (Blencowe et al 2013 Ped Res. 74:17-34).

Some reassurance regarding maternal morbidity may be obtained from Rashid et al (Rashid et al BJOG, 2004 111:1090-1094): in their study of women undergoing high order repeat caesarean sections,  the study group of five or more repeat caesarean sections, compared to the control group of three or four repeat caesarean sections, was only found to be associated with a longer operating time due to an increased rate of severe adhesions, and with reduced post operative haemoglobin values without an increase in blood transfusion rates.

Williams et al (Williams et al Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol 2018, 229:88-93) reported that, after a previous caesarean section, there was only a 10% increased risk of  preterm birth before 34 weeks gestation, a 1% increased risk between 34-36 weeks and no increased risk for delivery after 36 weeks, compared to elective delivery at 39-40 weeks.

In order to allay some of the fears of respiratory morbidity, principally transient tachypnea (‘wet lung”) in babies delivered late preterm or early term before 39 weeks gestation, the practice of administering maternal corticosteroids has become commonplace which in turn has seen some “flexibility” in the timing of delivery at early term or late preterm gestation. 

However Sotiriadis et al in their Cochrane systematic review ‘Corticosteroids for preventing neonatal respiratory morbidity after elective caesarean section at term’ (Sotiriadis et al Cochrane Syst Rev 2018, 8:CD006614) reported that, although the findings from the four trials reviewed appeared promising, there was a potential of bias due to the low event rates of significant respiratory morbidity in the study populations. Hence, more adequately powered high quality studies are required, as well as further trials on long term outcomes of the infants exposed.

Thus the article by Breslin et al (BJOG 2019 xxxx) in this edition has relevance as, despite the reduced clinical occurrence of women having a fourth caesarean section in Westernized countries, it provides reassurance that a policy of elective delivery at 39 weeks gestation for the fourth caesarean section is safely achievable without increasing  maternal morbidity (women with abnormal placentation were excluded) or neonatal morbidity, with this study being conducted from 1999-2002 when prophylactic maternal corticosteroid administration prior to caesarean section was not commonly practiced.
